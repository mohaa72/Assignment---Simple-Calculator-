This C programming project is a simple calculator that performs addition and subtraction operations. The program includes two functions, Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division each designed to handle the corresponding mathematical operation. The main function prompts the user to input two numbers, utilizes the defined functions to calculate the sum and difference, and finally prints the results with appropriate messages. This project provides a basic illustration of function usage, user input handling, and arithmetic operations in the C programming language.
